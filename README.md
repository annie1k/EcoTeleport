# EcoTeleport
Suggest an alternative way of transport that helps in reducing carbon footprint.
The amount of CO2 emission reduced will be displayed to motivate users in carbon reduction 
This is done so by first collecting user's mode of transportation used, distance travelled. Users will be able to choose car, bus or plane as their transportation mode.
If one would like to login, to keep a record of their carbon emission. They can choose to input additional information, such as the fuel efficiency of their vehicle.
With these collected data, the website will calculate the carbon emissions associated with each trip. the calculations, in defult, is based on standard emission factors for different modes of transportations.
With graph-displayed carbon emissions data, the user will be able to see their carbon emissions over time.
The more sustainable alternatives for transportation includes bicylce and by foot, which causes no emissions. This website would suggest alternatives based on the time required and the carbon emissions. For example, when the user selected car as the method of transportation. The app will suggest using bus or biking. Walking will only be suggested when it requires less than 40 minutes.
The website also includes a gamification element to incentivize users to adopt more sustainable habits. Users may set a target for the amount of carbon emission they would like to reduce. Once they achieved the set target, a congratulation page will pop out.
There are some design cosiderations we kept in mind through out this project. 
In our design, we used blue and yellow as our primary colour. As these two colours have a distinct difference for Protan, Deutran and tritan color blind individuals.
Our favicon is reminiscent of the location pin. We merged the idea of global warming and map function together, and came up with our current favicon, a cute polar bear, standing on an iceberge. The overall shape is a pin. The polar bear has an expression of "I found it!", and its cuteness may arouse the will to protect the polar bear by choosing a more environmentally friendly method. 
Our possible future improvements is to make the website more involving, by enabing users to view their friends' saved carbon emission and compete with each other.
We are also looking forward to expanding our transportation mode, to include other public transportations such as skytrain.

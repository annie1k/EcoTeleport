# About EcoTeleport

# EcoTeleport
## Inspiration
Inspired by our keynote speaker, we decide to create something meaningful. We end up choosing topics around improving sustainability in growing modern cities.

## What it does
- The web app helps users set daily goals for their carbon footprint for their commute. The web app uses the map to show the route for the origin and destination user input.
- The web app gives suggestions for the ecological way of transportation media, and the web app will show a fascinating congratulation page when users decide to take a more ecological way of transportation media.
- We will show an intuitive bar chart of users' carbon footprint historical values.

## How we built it
- UI/UX Design: Figma, drawing pad.
- Frontend Dev: HTML, CSS, React, Next.js.
- Backend Dev: C#, ASP.Net, Postgresql, PgAdmin 4.

## Challenges we ran into
- We had a hard time finalizing our database schema due to our MacOS limiting us from using SQL Express, we need to switch to PostgreSQL using PgAdmin which is hard to set up and connect to the .Net environment.
- We also had limited knowledge about the versioning of Next.js, we originally choose Google API but could not make our local version integrate with it well. So we pretty much restart our code repo and change to an alternative TomTom API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- It's our first time joining Hackathon, however, we all learn, collaborate, and build throughout the weekends.
- We are so proud that we could be highly focused and enthusiastic to stick to the end!

## What we learned
- We learned how full-stack development happens.
- We learned so much about both frontend and backend development.
- Had so many chances to seek help from mentors and volunteers so we learned many debugging hacks from them.

## What's next for EcoTeleport
 - We will add gamification elements allowing users to earn points and rewards, users could also compete with friends and neighbours.
- Add more encryption for user passwords and database security system.

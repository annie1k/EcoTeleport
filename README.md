# EcoTeleport
## Inspiration
Inspired by our keynote speaker, we decide to create something meaningful. We end up choosing topics around improving sustainability in growing modern cities.

## What it does
- The web app helps users set daily goals for their carbon footprint for their commute. The web app uses the map to show the route for the origin and destination user input.
- The web app gives suggestions for the ecological way of transportation media, and the web app will show a fascinating congratulation page when users decide to take a more ecological way of transportation media.
- We will show an intuitive bar chart of users' carbon footprint historical values.

## How we built it
- UI/UX Design: Figma, drawing pad.
- Frontend Dev: HTML, CSS, React, Next.js.
- Backend Dev: C#, ASP.Net, Postgresql, PgAdmin 4.

## Challenges we ran into
- We had a hard time finalizing our database schema due to our MacOS limiting us from using SQL Express, we need to switch to PostgreSQL using PgAdmin which is hard to set up and connect to the .Net environment.
- We also had limited knowledge about the versioning of Next.js, we originally choose Google API but could not make our local version integrate with it well. So we pretty much restart our code repo and change to an alternative TomTom API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- It's our first time joining Hackathon, however, we all learn, collaborate, and build throughout the weekends.
- We are so proud that we could be highly focused and enthusiastic to stick to the end!

## What we learned
- We learned how full-stack development happens.
- We learned so much about both frontend and backend development.
- Had so many chances to seek help from mentors and volunteers so we learned many debugging hacks from them.

## What's next for EcoTeleport
 - We will add gamification elements allowing users to earn points and rewards, users could also compete with friends and neighbours.
- Add more encryption for user passwords and database security system.

Suggest an alternative way of transport that helps in reducing carbon footprint.
The amount of CO2 emission reduced will be displayed to motivate users in carbon reduction 
This is done so by first collecting user's mode of transportation used, distance travelled. Users will be able to choose car, bus or plane as their transportation mode.
If one would like to login, to keep a record of their carbon emission. They can choose to input additional information, such as the fuel efficiency of their vehicle.
With these collected data, the website will calculate the carbon emissions associated with each trip. the calculations, in defult, is based on standard emission factors for different modes of transportations.
With graph-displayed carbon emissions data, the user will be able to see their carbon emissions over time.
The more sustainable alternatives for transportation includes bicylce and by foot, which causes no emissions. This website would suggest alternatives based on the time required and the carbon emissions. For example, when the user selected car as the method of transportation. The app will suggest using bus or biking. Walking will only be suggested when it requires less than 40 minutes.
The website also includes a gamification element to incentivize users to adopt more sustainable habits. Users may set a target for the amount of carbon emission they would like to reduce. Once they achieved the set target, a congratulation page will pop out.
There are some design cosiderations we kept in mind through out this project. 
In our design, we used blue and yellow as our primary colour. As these two colours have a distinct difference for Protan, Deutran and tritan color blind individuals.
Our favicon is reminiscent of the location pin. We merged the idea of global warming and map function together, and came up with our current favicon, a cute polar bear, standing on an iceberge. The overall shape is a pin. The polar bear has an expression of "I found it!", and its cuteness may arouse the will to protect the polar bear by choosing a more environmentally friendly method. 
Our possible future improvements is to make the website more involving, by enabing users to view their friends' saved carbon emission and compete with each other.
We are also looking forward to expanding our transportation mode, to include other public transportations such as skytrain.
